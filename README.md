Hey professor Kapoor! In this readme file you can (hopefully easily) navigate through the R markdown files for each lecture to find where I experimented with the code.

Lecture 1 (very basic experiments):
- line 21: Checking what changes when you change the arguments in the command.
- line 28&29: Getting different rows of data.
- line 41: Trying different commands such as table and barplot.
- line 61: Changing the regression model to look at different variables (government officials and unions).

Lecture 2:
- line 28: Varying the number of bootstrap samples.
- line 38: Using a different command for sampling.
- line 46: Calculating a 95% CI.
- line 57: Comparing bootstrap means to actual mean.
- line 107: Increasing the number of bootstrap samples.
- line 125: Adding controls to model.
- line 144: Changing the threshold in the BH algorithm.
  
Lecture 3:
- line 27: Comparing two models predicting log sales on price and brand, adding interaction term and then comparing AIC.
- line 53 and 75: Adding an interaction term between 'free' and 'money' if they both appear in the emails.
- line 86: Predicting probability of spam for five random emails.

Lecture 4:
- line 94: Add a new variable for time spent on each site and see change in optimal regularization parameter.

Lecture 5:
- line 31: Changing k nearest neighbour from 5 to 3.
- line 57: Increasing complexity of model by changing interaction term.
- line 81: Changing number of folds
- line 119: Changing the threshold to adjust the sensitivity of the classification model.
- line 140: Changing the threshold value rule.
- line 162: Use a range of thresholds to experiment with.
- line 257: Trying to learn how well the multinomial model classifies the observations into their respective glass types.

Lecture 6, part one:
- line 29: Explore whether the relationship between price and sales varies by brand by introducing interaction terms.
- line 33: Instead of assuming a linear relationship between log(sales) and log(price), you could experiment with a quadratic term.
- line 86: Adding interaction with time.
- line 128: Changing the regularization parameter to observe its impact.
- line 163: Create interaction terms between abortion rate and relevant socioeconomic factors.
- line 243: Romving certain players from the ice in the dataset to see impact on Dallas's likelihood of scoring.

Lecture 6, part 2: 
- line 68: This experiment changes the number of folds from 5 to 10.
- line 155: Trying to find the ATE for having went to the ER in the previous year (instead of doctor)
- line 315: This experiment changes the penalties in the LASSO model.
- line 357: Also changing the number of folds.
